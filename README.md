## Computer Vision - CISC 642

PR1:
 - Given point correspondances between two images, **PR1_A.py** and **PR1_functions.py** calculates the affine and persepctive transformation matrices.
 - **PR1_B.py** contains functions to convolve an image, reduce and expand its size, and build Gaussian and Laplacian Pyraminds.

PR2: 
- Built an algorithm to perform stereo matching given two images and compute the disparity maps

PR3: 
 - Trained a ResNet50 and typical CNN model for object classification with PyTorch
 - Tranied a fcn_resnet50 model for semantic segmentaion with PyTorch
